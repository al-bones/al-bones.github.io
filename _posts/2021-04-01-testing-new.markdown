I can see a whole future here. Posting feels incredible. 

*Anything* can be written on these pixels. And it can go *anywhere*. It's late at night and a soft blue light shines on my cheeks. They feel hot and red -- this is the thing *itself*, right here and everywhere. Each pixel, like a kindergartener sitting on the floor being split into groups for a game, being told what color they are. This information, from the teacher, comes from where exactly? What is the machinic language of the mind? 

It could be *rules*. A neuron fires, a bit flips. It fires according to a rule, and it is the dialectic of those rules constraining the available information from which a mind emerges.
