I discovered Walling earlier this afternoon and I'm now through with my dissociative-research-flow session and it feels like waking up from a lucid dream. Everywhere you dig there's gold. It's a seamless mode unto its own. It felt like using Figma for the first time, things just work. Buttery smooth document creation. This is a research tool I've been looking for for about two years. I tried Notion, Google Docs -- Roam seemed too graph-y, I wanted an interface.

I made a Wall of research I've been doing into internet subcultures for short fiction, or possibly screenwriting, projects. It felt like a flower blooming. Like a banner unfurling.
