title: Body Abstractions
---
Crime scene people outline a dead body in white chalk in the position it died in. 

In the movie Michael Clayton, the outline is only one line, a barbell, with two circles label "FT" for feet, and "HD" for head. The line was arced to the left, or right, I guess depending on whether you're lying there or standing over. 

My hypothesis: the outline was a Hollywood creation in the first place and so it's design can be analyzed only in thhis context. So then we see this object of design morphing into further abstraction. only one curve. 

the hollywood design of the outline: it is practical for the viewer so they can piece together the scene, have all the right info for the language of film to make sense. more than that, it's about creating a ghost in the room, a ghost in the image.
